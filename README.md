# First Portfolio

Welcome to my first portfolio project! This is a personal portfolio website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It showcases my skills, projects, and accomplishments, and serves as an introduction to who I am as a developer.

This project was created as part of my journey to learning front-end web development, and it's designed to demonstrate my understanding of basic web development concepts, including responsive design, styling, and interactivity.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio adapts to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle animations are implemented using CSS and JavaScript to enhance user experience.
- **Interactive Sections**: Hover effects and interactive buttons that provide a dynamic experience.
- **Project Showcase**: Displays selected projects with brief descriptions and links to the code or live demo.
- **Contact Form**: A simple form for visitors to contact me.
